When we remove 'using namespace std;' it shows an error message as the code cannot define context in which names are defined. 
In simpler terms, we are unable to use standard functionalities like cout, 
cin and endl which makes it invalid to declare other classes like name. 



When we remove 'Critter::' in 'Critter.cpp', it shows the error message because all the 
properties of Critter ( such as name and hunger) are defined inside the Critter class . 
Without the class, the definitions of critter cannot be defined.
